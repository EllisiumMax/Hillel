                Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
                documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted
                by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
                languages such as JavaScript.

                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
                conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level,
                often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket
                syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
                first-class functions.

                React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end,
                JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces or UI components.
                It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
                React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
                However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM,
                and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional
                libraries for state management and routing.
                Redux and React Router are respective examples of such libraries.

                core team members.Svelte applications do not include framework references.
                Instead, building a Svelte application generates code to manipulate the DOM,
                which may reduce the size of transferred files as well as give better
                client startup and run-time performance. Svelte has its own compiler
                for converting app code into client-side JavaScript at build time.
                It is written in TypeScript.The Svelte source code is licensed
                under MIT License and hosted on GitHub.
