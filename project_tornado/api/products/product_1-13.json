    "overview": "In order to call the external differences of the current version of the Q50 significant from the previous one, you need to be a fan of the brand. The shape of the radiator grille and the relief of the front bumpers have slightly changed. At the back, the design of the lanterns has changed - L-shaped dimensions have appeared; the shape of the rear bumper has also changed. As for the interior decoration, here the differences also need to be looked for: these are minor changes in the design of the steering wheel (lower spoke), as well as in the design of the gearbox selector. There is also a stitching on the front panel. That's all. But it's worth adding that the Sport and Sport Tech modifications are highlighted by a distinct front end design with a more aggressive front bumper and 19-inch wheels.",
