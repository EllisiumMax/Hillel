    "overview": "Ford's designers did a lot of work on the interior as well. No more bulky heaps - from now on, solid minimalism with a protruding 8-inch screen of the multimedia system (as a tribute to fashion) and neatly located buttons and twists of the air conditioning system. The new automatic washer, replacing the usual automatic transmission selector, gives the car a feeling of a certain premium. Equipped with a sedan is also not bad. Already in the base, the Focus boasts six airbags, emergency braking and lane-keeping systems, air conditioning, cruise control and automatic lights. Subsequent trim levels will include a parking assistant (very helpful for novice drivers), adaptive cruise, traffic sign recognition, LED optics, dual-zone climate control, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support, projection and 675W B&O premium audio system, and much more.",
